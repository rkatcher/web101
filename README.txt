Intro
----------------------
This app is for showing how easy it is to write deploy a simple web application. It is built on heroku using python
flask, but the principles are mostly universal no matter what language, framework, or environment you choose. It will
demonstrate the basics of coding for the web, and provide a framework for building much more.

----------------------
Getting started
----------------------
If you don't already have one, please
Create a free account on github.
Create a free account on heroku.

To get started, clone the repository at https://github.com/rkatcher/web101.git.
Test your app locally by running it with 'foreman start' and pointing a browser to http://localhost:5000/.
Then push it to a newly created heroku app that you own, and point a browser to https://yourHerokuAppName
.heroku.com/.

Build something really cool!
----------------------
So you've created a 'hello world' web app, now what?? This app is purely a demonstration. Please take the
code and modify it to do more interesting things!

 Suggested things to try and learn
 1. Html and css. Create a web page by modify the html file.
 2. Web routing. Have your page call link to new pages from our web server.
 3. Different http calls like GET and POST, use of forms for sending data to your server.
 4. Storing data on your server using a database. Start with a simple key/value db like redis, then move to a
 relational (e.g. postgres), nosql db (mongodb), or data service (e.g. Firebase).
