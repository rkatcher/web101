Intro
----------------------
This app is for showing how easy it is to write deploy a simple web application. It is built on heroku using python
flask, but the principles are mostly universal no matter what language, framework, or environment you choose. It will
demonstrate the basics of coding for the web, and provide a framework for building much more.

----------------------
Getting started
----------------------
If you don't already have one, please
Create a free account on github.
Create a free account on heroku.

To get started, clone the repository at https://github.com/rkatcher/hiku_sample_app.git, and then push it to a newly
created heroku app that you own.

Point a browser to https://yourHerokuAppName.heroku.com/showBeep. Then scan or speak into hiku. When deployed
properly, the scan/speak item will display an alert window in the open browser.

The sample app is currently deployed to https://hiku-sample-app.herokuapp.com/.
